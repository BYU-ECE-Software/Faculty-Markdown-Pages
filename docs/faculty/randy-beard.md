Randal W. Beard received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, in 1991, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering in 1993, the M.S. degree in mathematics in 1994, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering in 1995, all from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, N.Y. Since 1996, he has been with the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, where he is currently holds the Steven V. White University Professorship and is the department chair. In 1997 and 1998, he was a Summer Faculty Fellow at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA. In 2006-2007 he was a National Research Council Fellow at the Air Force Research Labs at Eglin Air Force Base, Fort Walton Beach, Florida, where he worked on vision-based guidance and control algorithms for micro air vehicles.  
<br>
His primary research focus is autonomous systems, unmanned air vehicles, and multiple vehicle coordination and control. He has published over 250 peer reviewed articles and has received over $15M in external research funding from AFOSR, AFRL, NASA, DARPA, and NSF. He is a fellow of the IEEE and the AIAA. He is a former associate editor for the IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, the Journal of Intelligent and Robotics Systems, and the IEEE Control Systems Magazine. He is the recipient of several awards including the 2024 AIAA Intelligent Systems Award and the 2017 Karl G. Maeser Distinguished Lecturer Award. His students have won numerous competitions and awards for their work on micro air vehicles.
